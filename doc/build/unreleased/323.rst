    Fixed parsing issue where attempting to render a single percent sign %
    using an escaped percent %% would not function correctly if the escaped
    percent were not the first character on a line.  Note that this is a revised
    version of a similar change made in Mako 1.3.1 which caused unexpected
    parsing regressions, resulting in the release being yanked.
